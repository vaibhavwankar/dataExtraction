# dataExtraction

Even though spaCy library provides a default model which can recognize a wide range of entities, Sometimes we want to extract the information based on our domain or industry. For example : in our case, we want to extract company name and NAV value of company, in that case we need to create our own custom NER.

This project trains spaCy's models to allow spaCy extract the Net Asset Value of company in the raw text.
